# Project Assignment 4: Data Analytics Research Project

## Purpose:
The Data Analytics Research Project demonstrates the application of concepts, methods, and tools learned throughout the course. Using a chosen dataset, we perform analyses using R, Python, and SQL to produce statistical summaries, visualizations, and conclusions.

## Deliverables:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Data ingestion and exploration using R, Python, and SQL.
   - Univariate and multivariate analyses with statistical summaries.
   - Good design for tables and visualizations (captions, titles, axis labels).

2. **Tools Used**:
   - **R** for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
   - **Python** for further analysis and visualizations.
   - **SQL** for data schema creation and query execution.

3. **Research Paper**:
   - Includes research questions, approach, literature search, analysis, results, and discussion.
   - Citations and references follow appropriate academic standards (APA, MLA, or IEEE).

## Files:
- **Python Files**:
  - `q1a.py`, `q1b.py`, `q1c.py`, `q3a.py`
- **R Files**:
  - `q2a.r`, `q2b.r`
- **SQL Files**:
  - `distributions.sql`
- **Database & Dataset**:
  - `student_adaptivity.db`
  - `students_adaptability_level_online_education.csv`

## Requirements:
- Use **R**, **Python**, and **SQL** for data analysis.
- Statistical summaries and visualizations must follow good design principles.
- Address univariate and multivariate analyses with appropriate techniques.
- Proper citations and references must be included in the final research paper.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analytics-research-project.git
   ```
   
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   Python packages can be installed with:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt --user
   ```

   Ensure you have R and SQL properly configured.
   Run each analysis file individually (example for Python):

   ```
   python q1a.py
   ```

   For SQL scripts:

   Load the database `student_adaptivity.db` into your preferred SQL environment.
   Execute queries in `distributions.sql`.
